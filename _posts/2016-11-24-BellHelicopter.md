#### CRM researchers reduced costs on physical stress tests of new helicopter designs by using data reduction methods to identify key forces and parameters to monitor based on data collected in flight tests.

An important part of the design of a new helicopter is the flight test,
where data is collected to measure the forces on different components of
the helicopter. Before a helicopter design is approved, stress tests are required to 
demonstrate that the design can withstand these forces over the expected lifetime
of the helicopter. A physical stress test is costly and time consuming,
and it can only investigate about a half-dozen forces. It is essential
to choose the correct forces from the flight test, which will then be
applied in the physical stress tests. The correct forces are the most extreme
forces in directions that cause wear and tear.
Choosing these forces is difficult, since millions of data points are
measured during the flight test and the data points evolve in high
dimensions.

Traditionally, Bell Helicopter uses expert knowledge to determine which data points are
likely to be important. The CRM team proposed
building a blind data reduction method with the aim of matching the selection achieved with expert knowledge. A research team consisting of a
professor, postdoctoral fellows, undergraduate and graduate
students worked with Bell Helicopter using ideas from convex
analysis and computational mathematics to find the required extreme
points. The results of the blind algorithm was a success, with the results
agreeing with the experts. 

These results led to successful physical stress testing on the new model of helicopter.
