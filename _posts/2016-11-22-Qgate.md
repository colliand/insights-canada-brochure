## Quantum gate design - IQST

#### A mathematical reformulation of a key quantum gate design problem resulted in a computationally efficient method that solves the problem in hours, rather than weeks or months of compute time.

The heart of a quantum computer is a basic logic gate that has several inputs
and outputs controlling a several basic quanta of information known as
qubits. The research group at the Institute for Quantum Science and Technology (IQST),
led by Dr. Barry Sanders at the University of Calgary, has developed a novel
machine learning method for creating the optimal design of a three qubit gate. This method, known as Subspace-selective Self-adaptive Differential
Evolution,  proved to be computational intractable for larger numbers of qubits.

IQST presented this design
problem at the 2015 PIMS Industrial Problem Solving Workshop held at the
University of Saskatchewan.  A four qubit design leads to a hard optimization
problem in $$4^4 = 256$$  dimensions. A mathematical reformulation of the
design problem led to an algorithmically simpler *feasible region* problem. The
result is a computationally efficient algorithm that solves the design in a
matter of hours of compute time, rather than weeks or months. 

The result was a functional design of a four qubit gate, which had never been acheived before.
