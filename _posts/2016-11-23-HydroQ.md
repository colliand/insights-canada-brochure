## Energy - Hydro-Québec


#### IPSW students developed a prototype optimization algorithm for use by TransÉnergie, resulting in an effective software tool to optimize electrical load limits in a high voltage transmission network.

A province-wide electric energy grid requires the efficient transfer of electrical generation capacity to manage the many and varied demands from electrical users across the system. Researchers Jean-Claude Rizzi and Guy Vanier at
Hydro-Québec/TransÉnergie are  designing methods for optimizing dynamic
transfer limits in  high voltage electrical networks. 

In collaboration with Dr. Michel Gendreau and students at 
Montreal's Industrial Problem Solving Workshop, the team built an abstract model of the problem and
developed optimization methods for solving it. By the end of the workshop, a
heuristic algorithm was proposed and later implemented by two students who ultimately  delivered a prototype of the software. 

This prototype grew into the basic tool for the engineers designing network exploitation
strategies at TransÉnergie. The Hydro-Québec researchers report the experience enabled them to make rapid
progress in their work through stimulating exchanges with academic researchers,
in a relaxed atmosphere. The IPSW experience was for them as productive as it was
pleasant.
