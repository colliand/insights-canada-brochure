# Energy - Hydro-Québec

A few years ago, Jean-Claude Rizzi and Guy Vanier from  the
Hydro-Québec/TransÉnergie Research Institute were designing a method for optimizing dynamic
transfer limits in a  high-tension electrical network. Joining the 
Montreal Industrial Problem Solving workshop allowed these researchers, with the help of Dr. Michel Gendreau 
and some students, to build an abstract model of the problem and
find optimization methods for solving it. At the end of the week a
heuristic algorithm had been proposed and two of the students were already
working on its implementation. They were interested in pursuing their work
and delivered a prototype of the required software. The solution
implemented at TransÉnergie grew directly out of this prototype and is now
a basic tool for the engineers designing the network exploitation
strategies. The workshop enabled rapid progress in the research and have
stimulating exchanges with academic researchers, in a relaxed atmosphere.
The IPSW  experience was described as useful as it was pleasant.
