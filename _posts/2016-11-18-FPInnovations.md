## Forestry - FPInnovations

#### The Applied Statistics and Data Science Group at UBC works with FPInnovations to develop statistical measures ensuring consistent quality in lumber products for structural engineering applications

Canada’s wood products industry is investing to enable the use of wood in larger and taller buildings so that this renewable resource will play a greater role in providing environmentally friendly building solutions.  As communities slowly transform to accommodate a growing population and changing demographics, these solutions are needed to selectively convert areas to larger buildings.  To ensure the long-term success of this initiative, the industry is committed to ensuring the consistency in the performance of Canadian lumber in structural engineering applications, against a potential decline due to widespread changes to the wood fibre basket as a result of the changing climate’s impact and/or major regional disturbances such as forest fires or insect attack.  Commissioned by industry, FPInnovations, working with researchers in the UBC Statistics Department and staff in the Department’s Applied Statistics and Data Science Group (ASDa), developed the sampling framework and analysis tools for a long term lumber monitoring program.  The program, which minimizes sampling costs while reducing the time to detection of any potential downward trend, is based on a novel longitudinal statistical technique for assessing trend.  This program was piloted in a two-year cross-Canada study, which readily convinced the forestry industry of its merits and put Canada in the lead internationally.  Recognizing that improvements might be possible, the group’s membership and range of expertise was expanded with support from FPInnovations and two successive NSERC Collaborative Research and Development Grants, leading to a commitment of over one million dollars over a period of ten years.  These grants now support the work of a large team of researchers from Simon Fraser University, UBC and FPInnovations. This team has made breakthroughs in applying fundamental statistical methods in the assessment of existing and new wood products, enabling the regulatory system to accommodate more innovative products from this sustainable resource.
