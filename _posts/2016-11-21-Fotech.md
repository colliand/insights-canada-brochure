## Oil & Gas - Fotech Inc.

#### 	Developed for markets in seismic imaging and monitoring pipelines and railways, an IPSW team introduced novel algorithms to process signals from fibre optic sensing devices.

Distributed acoustic sensing devices (DAS) are built from long fibre optic cables that are interrogated using a laser and detector at one end, to sense micro vibrations at any point along the fibre. Such a cabling system can be a cost-effective method to collect data across many kilometers of commercial infrastucture.

In current oil recovery technologies, fluid flow and fracturing processes can be
monitored with these fibre
optic cables installed in a deep bore hole in the earth.  The 2015 PIMS Industrial Problem Solving Workshop in Saskachewan supported a project to determine how single-component
sensor data can be used to provide information about fracture hypocentres.
Travel time, Eikonal equations, and least squares modelling of the data are
all used to improve the resolution of the sensing equipment.

This research collaboration has developed into an NSERC-funded internship with Fotech,
implementing novel signal processing algorithms for other DAS applications in
monitoring pipelines, rail lines, and other linear assets in the field.
