## Mining - Potash Corp.

#### An optimization algorithm was refined and developed into an interactive tool for managing operation of a network of potash mines located across Canada.

Managing a network of mines is a complex operation, as each mine has its own unique character resulting from a range of products at various capacities, with various amounts of space for
on-site inventory storage,  with various processing facilities to refine products, and with unique transportation access and costs. 

The Potash Corporation, headquartered in the Province of Saskatchewan, has mines at locations around the world and supplies a global market for fertilizer and crop nutrients that are essential in modern agriculture. 

Scheduling of shut-downs and starts-up of each potash mine, and adhering to a variety of labour and fiscal constraints, are critical in determining the network operations. Ultimately the goal of a commercial mining operation is to maximize profits over a sustained period of time, taking into consideration the constraints of operation while responding to opportunities in the marketplace. The researchers at Potash Corp presented a challenge to the participants of the 2015 PIMS Industrial Problem Solving Workshop, to come up with an effective software algorithm to aid in optimizing the operations of the mines. A key improvement was to provide feedback to the operators on how to adjust the algorithm on the fly, to provide useful and reliable results for real operations over a sustained period. The result was an interactive software tool used as a prototype for managing these distributed mine operations.
