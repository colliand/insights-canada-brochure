Notes to self.

We have three branches at solutions repo, and I'm getting confused!
- master branch seems to be the fixed code
= gh-pages seems to be the source for creating the pretty final version. I think it is the last trusted version.
- ver2 is my branch that I was fixing to give to Ian.


So, to make fixes I need to update to the master branch. (I think. Maybe it is Gh-pages. Ask Ian.)

So, so this:
- git checkout master
- git pull
(which will switch me to master branch)

I fucked around with success.html, it should look like this now:
{% assign posts=site.posts | where:"lang", page.lang %} 
{% for post in posts %}
{% if post.categories contains page.lang %}
<section class="bg-primary {% cycle 'even', 'odd' %}" id="{{post.shorttitle}}">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 text-center">
                <h1 class="section-heading">{{ site.t.success.heading[page.lang] }}</h1>
                <hr class="primary">
                 {{ post.content }}
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

I also removed a couple things from Bell Helicopter that put in a fake like. Because success.html does it for me now. So fix those too. 


ANd on _config.yml add to the bottom
success:
    heading:
      en: "SUCCESS STORIES"
      fr: "HISTORIES DE CAS"

To build the site locally, use the terminal and type:
jekyll build

To see the site as it should look online, use the terminal and type
jekyll serve

To launch the site for everyone to see (caution: this is public), type
surge _site
